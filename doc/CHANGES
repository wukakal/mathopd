Changes between Mathopd 1.5 and Mathopd 1.6

The '*' character in Error*File and AutoIndexCommand is
replaced with the current value of the Host header.

If the Error*File is not present, the original HTTP status code
is sent back, rather than a 500 error.

IPv6 support has been added.

The server can now fork multiple copies of itself, via the
NumProcesses keyword.

Mathopd can now (optionally) allow //, /./ and /../ in URL
paths. Thanks for Peter Pentchev for suggesting this and providing
initial patches.

Attempts have been made to add support for large (>2GB) files on
32-bit operating systems. FreeBSD, Linux and Solaris
have been tested so far.

The following keywords have been added:

	ExpireInterval
	Family
	Options
	NumProcesses
	PID
	SanitizePath

Mathopd will drop the connection when it detects a TLS handshake,
instead of logging a cryptic error message.
